# HLedger Plain Text Accounting on Nextcloud

[HLedger](https://hledger.org/) is cross-platform accounting software for both power users and folks new to accounting. It's good for tracking money, time, investments, cryptocurrencies, inventory and more.

[Plain Text Accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) means doing accounting with plain text data formats and scriptable software.

## Why Plain Text Accounting on Nextcloud?

Rather than storing financial data in a rigid or proprietary database, you can just record all your transactions as text and let the reporting tools do the hard work.

As a file storage system with desktop sync and mobile access, Nextcloud is a natural fit for plain text accounting. It provides a safe, private, easily accessible place to store your financial data. It provides security, online editing, multi-user, collaboration, desktop sync and mobile device access without compromising privacy or forcing you to trust a company as you must do with tools like Quicken, Mint, YNAB, etc...
